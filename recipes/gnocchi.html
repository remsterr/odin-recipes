    <ol>
        <li>Add water to pot and bring to a boil</li>
        <li>Peel your potatoes while the water is boiling and rinse them off</li>
        <li>Add potatoes to water. Let sit until cooked. You will know they are cooked when your knife can easily glide into the potatoes with resistance</li>
        <li>Remove potatoes from water, drain water from pot.</li>
        <li>Use ricer to crush potatoes into your bowl. Let the potatoes sit until they have cooled off to room temperature. This may take hours</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Steps in Stage 2:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put potatoes on counter in a small mountain</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flower around potatoes until all of it used</li>
        <li>Create a small crater in the top of the mountain of potatoes. Crack your egg and pour your egg into the crater. Beat egg.</li>
        <li>From the outside inwards, start to mix your flour onto your potatoes</li>
        <li>Mix until potatoes turn into a dough-like ball</li>
        <li>Let sit for a minute</li>
        <li>Cut off pieces from the dough ball. Roll these pieces out into long, thin strips. Cut these strips in 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>Boil water</li>
        <li>Add pieces of gnocchi to water</li>
        <li>Remove when cooked. You will know they are cooked because they will float to the top</li>
        <li>Serve with the sauce of your choice!</li>
    </ol>
